# Repository Inventory — Architecture Readiness

> Descriptive architecture inventory of the **AI Executive Platform** repository.
> Purpose: let an external AI architect review the structure and its readiness without reading every file. Implementation/sprint status lives in `docs/architecture/Platform-Maturity.md` (authoritative); this doc covers structure, contracts, decisions, and readiness.
> Regenerated: **2026-07-21** · Repo state: deployed multi-agent Next.js app (~29 TS/TSX source files), 1 product vertical with 10 agents (1 productionized, 9 runnable-but-untested), Postgres persistence with a **project** primary entity, live eval harness, 7 ADRs. Git: `main` @ `00ba963`, 23 commits. **Two remotes**: `origin` → `github.com/danaaro/ai-executive-platform` (canonical), `susiesbrain` → `github.com/danaaro/SusiesBrain` (Vercel deploy source).

## Repository Overview

The AI Executive Platform is the multi-product SaaS being built by **SusanDana Co** (Susan Pike-Gubler + Dana Aronovich). It sells **AI executives and specialist agents** to customer companies. Internal company-OS agents are a separate, parked track in the parent workspace and are excluded here.

The repo has moved from a single-vertical prototype to a **deployed, multi-agent, persistent product**: all 10 of Susan's production agents run behind a shared guardrails layer and generic orchestrator; the Job Description agent is the flagship — text + real-time voice, DB-anchored conversation continuity, a live progress meter, and the platform's first eval harness. The app is live at `https://susies-brain.vercel.app`, invitation-only, with Dana and Susan as admins. As of 2026-07-21, **a project is the platform's primary entity** (ADR-007): every persisted conversation and artifact belongs to exactly one project (the hiring role being worked), and artifact versioning is per-project rather than per-user. The architecture claim — platform + declarative product verticals (ADR-001) — is now exercised at n=10 agents within one product, though still n=1 at the *product* level.

Methodology is docs-first / architecture-first: every folder carries a README contract, hard decisions get ADRs, and agent content is declarative Markdown loaded by a product-agnostic runtime.

## Architecture Readiness at a Glance

| Layer | Readiness | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Repository topology (ADR-001) | 🟢 Decided & built | Fixed tree, platform/product split enforced by CLAUDE.md rules; holds at 10 agents |
| Runtime stack (ADR-003) | 🟢 Decided & built | Next.js 15 App Router + TS + `@anthropic-ai/sdk`; dev port 3010 |
| Authentication (ADR-004) | 🟢 Decided & built | Clerk: middleware, invitation-only sign-up, deterministic API 401s. No authz-per-resource/orgs/tenancy |
| Voice architecture (ADR-005) | 🟢 Decided & built, rebuilt for continuity | ElevenLabs Agents (WebRTC) + custom-LLM SSE adapter; now DB-anchored via signed HMAC voice grants (`src/shared/voice-grant.ts`) instead of an in-memory handoff — survives dropped calls and serverless instance changes |
| Persistence (ADR-006) | 🟢 Decided & built | Supabase Postgres (eu-central-1) + Drizzle; users/conversations/messages/artifacts live; role-scoped agents persist, candidate-scoped stay ephemeral by design |
| Project as primary entity (ADR-007) | 🟢 Decided & built (2026-07-21) | `projects` table; conversations/artifacts require `project_id`; versioning per-project, not per-user. `/projects` list + `/projects/[id]` workspace; chat page gates the 5 project-scoped agents behind a project picker. Live data migrated into per-owner "Legacy imports" projects, nothing lost |
| Product naming (ADR-002) | 🟡 **Open** | "interview-intelligence" internal-only; public brand undecided — only ADR touching customer-facing surfaces, and the app is now demoable |
| Deployment | 🟢 Decided & executed | Live on Vercel (`susies-brain.vercel.app`), Git auto-deploy from `danaaro/SusiesBrain` main, ~44s builds. Correct-account discipline now in permanent memory after a same-day rollback incident |
| Evaluation | 🟢 Built | `scripts/run-evals.ts`: 10 golden cases + 3 guardrail probes against the live runtime. First clean full-suite run: 88% combined, structural 100%, guardrails 6/6. Later runs were targeted single-case reruns while fixing specific findings (one still flags the JD's structure/word count as off-spec), not repeat full-suite scores |
| Agent chaining | 🔴 Not built | Agents 1–10 are independent chats; the project entity now gives them a shared home with real version history, but no agent's approved output auto-fills the next agent's input yet (immediate next build-queue step) |
| Observability / logging | 🔴 Not built | `console.error` only; architecture doc placeholder |
| Knowledge / memory | 🔴 Not built | Empty scaffolds + placeholder docs |

**Architecture docs:** 1 of 8 real (`Voice.md` 🟢); the other 7 (`HighLevelArchitecture`, `Authentication`, `MemoryArchitecture`, `KnowledgeArchitecture`, `Communication`, `Observability`, `Deployment`) are 🔴 placeholders — the substance lives in the 7 ADRs and the code.

## Architecture Decisions

| ADR | Title | Status | Essence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 001 | Repository Structure | **Accepted** | Platform + declarative product verticals; code only in `src/`; products are declarative folders; holds at 10 agents |
| 002 | Product Naming & Branding | **Proposed (open)** | `interview-intelligence` internal-only; no INT²/"Interview Intelligence" in customer-facing artifacts; decide before first external demo — the app is now live and demoable, raising the stakes |
| 003 | Runtime Stack | **Accepted** | Next.js (TS, App Router) + Anthropic SDK; Vercel deploy target — now executed |
| 004 | Authentication Provider | **Accepted** | Clerk for login/user management; database decision deferred here, made in ADR-006 |
| 005 | Voice Conversation Provider | **Accepted** | ElevenLabs Agents for the real-time voice leg; Claude stays the brain via custom-LLM callback; continuity mechanism rebuilt 2026-07-19 on top of ADR-006's persistence |
| 006 | Persistence Layer | **Accepted (2026-07-19)** | Supabase Postgres + Drizzle over Neon/other options; versioned artifact slots; role-scoped agents persist conversations, candidate-scoped agents don't (zero personal data until Phase 2 retention) |
| 007 | Project as Primary Entity | **Accepted (2026-07-21)** | `projects` table is the unique key everything hangs off (Dana's framing); conversations/artifacts require `project_id`; versioning moves from per-owner to per-project; Phase-1 scope only, candidate sub-entities deferred; existing live data auto-migrated, nothing orphaned |

**Next ADRs implied by the current state:** ADR-002 resolution (brand); eventually a tenancy model (Clerk Organizations, queue step 6). Agent chaining (auto-filling agent N's input from a project's approved artifacts) is enabled by ADR-007 but doesn't need its own ADR — it's an application-layer feature, not an architecture decision.

---

## Contracts & Specifications

- **Agent spec framework:** `docs/agent-specifications/` — ADS + Executive + Specialist templates, real content, still 🟡 Draft while 10 agents already ship against them (drift risk, unchanged from before).
- **Implemented agents:** all 10 of Susan's production agents have a definition + prompt + input/output schemas. Job Description is the only one with a dedicated route, live voice, DB-anchored continuity, a progress meter, and eval coverage; the other 9 share the generic orchestrator/route and are unreviewed by Dana.
- **Guardrails layer:** `prompts/system/guardrails.md`, prepended platform-wide — scope lockdown, hard refusal ("This request cannot be answered by this assistant."), non-disclosure, methodology integrity. Verified via 3 guardrail probes in the eval harness (100% pass in the latest run) plus manual live probes during import.
- **Evals:** `products/interview-intelligence/evals/cases/cases.json` — 10 golden cases (structural regex + LLM-judge rubric) + guardrail probes across 3 agents. Runner: `scripts/run-evals.ts`. 8 runs logged under `generated/evals/`; judge variance is high enough (25–88% across runs) that a single run isn't yet a reliable gate — flagged as debt.
- **Planned agents (named only):** AI Head of Talent Acquisition (executive layer), Susan Brain. `docs/pitch-deck-feature-map.md` maps the market-validated feature surface onto the current catalog.
- **Platform-wide schemas** (`schemas/` at repo root): still empty — message envelope, agent-definition schema, eval-result schema not yet needed while everything lives under one product.

## Readiness Risks (what an architect should know before building on this)

1. **Declarative-products claim proven at n=10 agents, still n=1 at the product level** — the generic orchestrator now serves 10 agents cleanly, but a genuinely second *product* (separate domain, not just another agent in interview-intelligence) hasn't been attempted.
2. **Project entity exists, chaining doesn't yet** — projects give agents 1–4 a shared home with real version history (ADR-007), but agents still require manually pasting the previous agent's output as input; auto-fill is the single biggest gap left between the deployed app and the intended workflow, and is the next build-queue step.
3. **Two git remotes for one working tree** (`origin` = architecture history, `susiesbrain` = what Vercel actually deploys) — fine today, a real desync risk the moment a push targets only one of them.
4. **Voice continuity has an automated guard but no human verification yet** — `test:voice` (18 checks) passes, but a real dropped-call resume by Dana/Susan hasn't been tried live. Separately, quality on the JD itself is measured now (a real change from before this sprint) but only one full-suite eval run exists so far (88%); not yet enough runs to know how much the judge score naturally varies.
5. **Voice now depends on three systems staying in sync** — ElevenLabs' dashboard config (not IaC), the HMAC grant secret, and the DB; a mismatch in any one silently breaks voice.
6. **Brand quarantine one demo from violation** — the app is live and demoable to Susan today; the internal name is still exposed in the UI, and ADR-002 remains open.
7. **Doc-code drift recurred** — this regeneration exists because two already-shipped features (voice-continuity rebuild, progress meter) went undocumented for a stretch. The "regenerate at end of sprint" rule needs an enforcement mechanism, not just intent.
8. **Auth is real, tenancy is not** — single shared data space by role, not by organization; acceptable for the current two-admin pilot, not for a second customer company.

Full technical-debt register (25 items) and sprint plan: `docs/architecture/Platform-Maturity.md`.

*Maintenance: regenerate alongside the Platform-Maturity dashboard when the repo's structure or decisions change. If this doc and the repo disagree, the repo wins.*
